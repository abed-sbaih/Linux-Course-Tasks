This file contains the steps taken to create the yum local repository, which contains
zabbix rpms, and configuring it to work using yum, by installing tmux, apache (httpd)
and mysql.
After configuring it, installing some files only from that repository.

First, we will install tmux using the command:
yum install tmux

Then, we will install httpd and mysql:
yum install httpd mysql -y

After that we will install createrepo:
yum install createrepo

After that we will create a configuration file for owr repository temporarily,
and will create the repo after:
vim /etc/yum.repos.d/zabbix.repo

and add the following text:
[zabbix]
name=Zabbix
baseurl=https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/4.4/rhel/7/x86_64/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

and try to install a package from zabbix after disabling other repositories, using:
yum install zabbix-server

It installs some rpms and dependencies but not all of them.

Now, we will create the directory containing all zabbix rpms:
pwd
-> /tmp/task1
mkdir zabbixrepo
cd zabbixrepo
wget -A rpm -r --no-check-certificate https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/4.4/rhel/7/x86_64/

Which will get all rpms and store them in the current directory, which is
/tmp/task1/zabbixrepo and then create the repository, using:
createrepo /tmp/task1/zabbixrepo

then we will change the entry of the base url in the config file
/etc/yum.repos.d/zabbix.repo
to the newly created repository
baseurl=file:///tmp/task1/zabbixrepo
and test the repository.

The repository was tested, some dependencies must be installed
with the required package.

Some dependencies are not installed, therefore we will enable all repositories
in yum, to see if the dependencies are there using:
yum-config-manager --enable \*

To check for these dependencies you can use:
yum deplist <package name>

After enabling all repositories, even like this the dependencies were not installed,
therefore to install them we used the following command:
yum deplist <package-name> | grep providor | gawk '{ print $2}' | xargs yum -y install
This way all dependencies can be installed before the package itself, and after it
use:
yum install <package-name>
