-We have created two scripts (created in /tmp/task2):
1. collectStats.sh script: which is used to collect data for all item types: used disk
space, free disk space, used memory space, free memory space, and cpu utilization. It
then tidies the data, and stores in a systemStats directory defined in the
current directory. This directory contains 5 subdirectories for each item type.
(systemStats/usedDisk, systemStats/freeDisk, systemStats/usedMemory,
systemStats/freeMemory, systemStats/cpuUtils directories). A cronjob is created to
execute this script every 1 hour, to acquire the data. And the data is saved to files
with name format: (item-type_time-stamp).

2. calAvgs.sh script: uses the data collected to calculate the avgs for each item type
and stores the resulting averages in a directory called 'avgs' in the current directory.

-http service was enabled as follows in order to use http connection to the internet:
1. httpd was restarted
systemctl restart httpd

2. an index.html file was added to /var/www/html directory. containing the required
info.

3. http service was added permanently to the firewall.
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http

4. 80 and 443 ports were added permanently to the firewall.
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=443/tcp

5. firewall was reloaded.
firewall-cmd --reload

6. the url used to connect to chrome is <server-id>:80 for the main index.html file.

-Three other html files were defined in /var/www/html called:
1. cpuUsage.html: this html file shows all data collected for the cpu utilization
        and the cpu utilization average.
2. memoryUsage.html: this html file shows all data collected for memory free space and
        memory used space, as well as their average.
3. diskUsage.html: this html file shows all data collected for disk free space and
        disk used space, as well as their corresponding averages.

-Also, three format files were created that contain the content for the html
files, and will be used to append output from collecting data, and then put them
in the html file. All format files have the same name as the html file above.

-The second script is executed after the first script.

-A cronjob was created for the first script to be executed, it was set to run every
2 mins for sake of testing.
